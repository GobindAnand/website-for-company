Create a website for a company called Sync-X. The task is:
You're a member of sync-x, a crowdsourced initiative, working to improve the status of online education in remote towns/villages in this unprecedented time. Owing to the challenges faced by schools/colleges, your team has come up with a software which uses very low bandwidth to stream online content, making it ideal for places with connectivity issues. In order to get your product to the market, create a branding website for the solution you've come up with.

The website should ideally contain 4-5 pages/sections essentially describing the solution and the company. Although not mandatory, you're free to extend backend functionality to your website.
This repository has been created especially for HacktoberFest 2020!

SO think how can we reduce bandwidth... this can be done by reducing the picture quality and a group class on television
